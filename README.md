# Regular-Expression-Interpreter

This project is an Ocaml program which interprets regular expression. 
The project has three parts: algorithms on NFAs; converting a DFA to an NFA; and converting/working with Regular Expressions. 
NFAs and DFAs are implemented in src/nfa.ml, and regexes in src/regex.ml.
